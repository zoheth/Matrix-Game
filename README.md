## 📝 Overview
**Matrix-Game** is a 17B-parameter interactive world foundation model for controllable game world generation.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Feature 1**: **Interactive Generation.**  A diffusion-based image-to-world model that generates high-quality videos conditioned on keyboard and mouse inputs, enabling fine-grained control and dynamic scene evolution.
- 🚀 **Feature 2**: **GameWorld Score.** A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Minecraft world models across four key dimensions, including visual quality, temporal quality, action controllability, and physical rule understanding. 
- 💡 **Feature 3**: **Matrix-Game Dataset** A large-scale Minecraft dataset with fine-grained action annotations, supporting scalable training for interactive and physically grounded world modeling.

## 🔥 Latest Updates

* [2025-05] 🎉 Initial release of Matrix-Game Model

### GameWorld Score Benchmark Comparison

| Model     | Image Quality ↑ | Aesthetic Quality ↑ | Temporal Cons. ↑ | Motion Smooth. ↑ | Keyboard Acc. ↑ | Mouse Acc. ↑ | 3D Cons. ↑ |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Oasis     | 0.65             | 0.48        | 0.94              | **0.98**          | 0.77             | 0.56          | 0.56        |
| MineWorld | 0.69             | 0.47        | 0.95              | **0.98**          | 0.86             | 0.64          | 0.51        |
| **Ours**  | **0.72**         | **0.49**    | **0.97**          | **0.98**          | **0.95**         | **0.95**      | **0.76**    |

**Metric Descriptions**:

- **Image Quality** / **Aesthetic**: Visual fidelity and perceptual appeal of generated frames  
- **Temporal Consistency** / **Motion Smoothness**: Temporal coherence and smoothness between frames  
- **Keyboard Accuracy** / **Mouse Accuracy**: Accuracy in following user control signals  
- **3D Consistency**: Geometric stability and physical plausibility over time

  Please check our [GameWorld](https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game/tree/main/GameWorldScore) benchmark for detailed implementation.

### Human Evaluation

![Human Win Rate](assets/imgs/human_win_rate.png)

> Double-blind human evaluation by two independent groups across four key dimensions: **Overall Quality**, **Controllability**, **Visual Quality**, and **Temporal Consistency**.  
> Scores represent the percentage of pairwise comparisons in which each method was preferred. Matrix-Game consistently outperforms prior models across all metrics and both groups.


## 🚀 Quick Start

```
# clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.git
cd Matrix-Game

# install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
